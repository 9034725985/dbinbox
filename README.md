DropboxDropbox
==============

a dropbox for your dropbox

By visiting your personal Dropbox Dropbox url, non-Dropbox users will be able to upload files straight into a special Dropbox folder in your Dropbox.

This is also quite handy if you need to send yourself a file from someone else's computer but don't want to log into email or remember a tinyurl.
