dbinbox
======

an inbox for your Dropbox

By visiting your personal dbinbox url, non-Dropbox users will be able to upload files straight into a special inbox folder in your Dropbox.

This is also quite handy if you need to send yourself a file from someone else's computer but don't want to log into email or remember a tinyurl.
